# QUASAR FRAMEWORK

DEVELOPED BY | EVENT HORIZON GAMES

## ABOUT QMF

QUASAR was founded on a notion that all games should be bent to the will of both its own creators and outside creators alike.

QUASAR is designed and worked into the base game to provide many new features and functions to the game as a whole.

QUASAR adds various new forms of content, such as the capacity for player abilties, a managable XP and Quest system, and much more. 

QUASAR also features many multiplayer-centric improvements, optimizations and features.
