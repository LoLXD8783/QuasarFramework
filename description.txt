The above cosmetics can be disabled with an implemented config.

QUASAR does not work well with other mods due to the drastic changes and departures it makes from the base game.

It is recommended to only use mods that are within the QUASAR family (listed below).

Finally, Æterna is not responsible for any misuse, malicious handling or repurposing of the QUASAR FRAMEWORK.
